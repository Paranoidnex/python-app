CI/CD Pipeline with AWS ECS, ECR & CodeBuild

Designed and implemented an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild to automate Docker image build and deployment workflows.

Built and pushed Docker images to Amazon ECR, enabling versioned and secure container image storage.

Deployed containerized microservices on Amazon ECS (Fargate) for fully managed, serverless container orchestration.

Configured IAM roles, task execution roles, and security groups to ensure secure and least-privilege access across services.

Implemented blue-green deployments on ECS, reducing deployment downtime from ~15 minutes to zero downtime.

Improved deployment reliability and rollback safety through automated pipeline stages.
